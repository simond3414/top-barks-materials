# Show training

One-to-one ringcraft training.

[Get in touch](/contact)

## Details

I offer ringcraft training on a one-to-one basis at your home or a venue of your choice.  If you are looking to get started on the road to showing your dog to a high standard, and don't know where to start, these sessions are for you.



I have a wealth of experience and show currently in the UK and Europe. I have appeared a number of times at Crufts with group and best in show wins to our credit at open and championship show level.

 

My proudest achievement to date is one of our dogs being awarded best puppy in show at the Scottish Kennel Club Show in August 2017. I specialise in showing gundogs, having shown clumber spaniels and italian spinoni in the past. Please contact me for more details.



## Pricing structure

I offer both single lessons, blocks of 4 1-hour lessons and tailor made packages for locations within the York radius. Other areas are covered. Please contact us for a quote.
