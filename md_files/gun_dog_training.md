# Gundog training

Train your pet to be a gun dog.

[Get in touch](/contact)

## Details

I specialise in helping people who have family pet gundogs who may not want to take their dog shooting by giving them an outlet for what they have been bred to do. Training is of course open to non gundog breeds and provides excellent stimulation for your pet. 

I help establish obedience basics to shape a well mannered dog both home environment and out in the world and teach  gundog skills so that owners and dogs can be effective and have fun together in their daily exercise.



I teach people, not dogs. I work on teaching owners with pet dogs to have fun together, enjoying a relationship based on clear rules, boundaries and respect. My methods are always kind, fair and effective.

 

Of course you may want to take your pet shooting and this can be catered for too. I compete with my dogs in working tests and trials with one dog running currently at open level. I also go beating with my spaniels and hope to have my bracco picking up on shoots this season.



## Pricing structure

I offer both single lessons and blocks of 4 1-hour lessons for locations within the York radius. Other areas are covered. Please contact us for a quote.
